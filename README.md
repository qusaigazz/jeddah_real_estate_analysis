## **About**
---
In May 2025, the Saudi Cabinet approved a decision allowing the Ministry of Housing to sell residential units from its projects to individuals who are not beneficiaries of government housing support.

This new legislation presents an opportunity for non-beneficiaries to invest in real estate. This project aims to identify potentially undervalued apartment properties—given the increase in supply—with the goal of aiding prospective investors in finding promising opportunities.

## **Methodology**
---
This project takes inspiration of Steve Ash's methodology [How to Spot Under-Valued Properties—With Steve Ash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqNe_3cOHe4), which outlines a three-stage process that progressively zones in on potentially undervalued properties.

### **Macro**
At the Macro scale we identify neighborhoods with mean price per meter squared below the city-wide average, this helps narrow our search to specific neighborhoods

### **Miso**
At this stage of the process we search for anomalous price discrepancies between neighborhoods which could indicate potential undervalue properties
